# component-articletemplate
> An article template.

## TODO

- [ ] Create a TODO list of bad ideas to refactor.
- [ ] getClassNameList should not be passed directly into the WifArticleHeader, etc.
- [ ] Encapsulate some components more.
- [ ] Work out where we can remove classes, to remove components, and instead using the elements to contain their styling as we are meant to.
